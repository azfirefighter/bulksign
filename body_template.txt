Hello there!

I've checked your identity at a keysigning party and signed your GPG public
key as a followup. Note that I will not upload your public key to any
keyserver and each UID that you've associated with that public key is sent out
in individual mails to each of the addresses.

My fingerprint: ${signer_fp}
Your fingerprint: ${signee_fp}
Your UID: ${signee_uid}

All the best,
${signer_name}
